Moreover, as the planets orbit in the plane of the solar system, they change their direction-of-motion continuously, with Earth returning to its starting point after 365 days.  Well, almost to its same exact starting point.

Because even the Sun itself isn’t stationary. Our Milky Way galaxy is huge, massive, and most importantly, is in motion. All the stars, planets, gas clouds, dust grains, black holes, dark matter and more move around inside of it, contributing to and affected by its net gravity. From our vantage point, some 25,000 light years from the galactic center, the Sun speeds around in an ellipse, making a complete revolution once every 220–250 million years or so.

It’s estimated that our Sun’s speed is around 200–220 km/s along this journey, which is quite a large number compared both Earth's rotation speed and its speed-of-revolution around the Sun, which are both inclined at an angle to the Sun's plane-of-motion around the galaxy. Throughout it, though, the planets remain in the same plane, with no "dragging" or vortex patterns emerging.
